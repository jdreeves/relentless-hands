      <p>No one has the ability to stop or slow down time. Some of us view time as river, flowing

steadily past us. Others view it as something we ourselves move through, while it remains

static and passes underfoot. No matter how you view it, we can all agree time’s passing

is incessant, and perhaps more alarmingly, seems to accelerate with every year of our

lives. Sit in a quiet room with a ticking clock long enough and you might go insane, every

click a reminder of a second you can never have back.

Time is that intangible thing we all still make an effort to grasp. </p>

anybody, I know it not." ­- St. Augustine</p>

        <p>One experiment with predictable and somewhat disheartening results is to look back on

the past couple of months. What did you do? Of course we could give a broad summary

but considering that most of us try to live our lives with purpose, it sure seems to all blend

into an indistinguishable blur. Wow, where did that time go? While our days are filled with

monotony, errands and distractions, the sands of time slip through our fingers. Is there a

way to tighten our grips?</p>

      <p>While moving back and forth through time is something we only see in movies and tv

shows, there is some evidence to suggest that time does have the ability to warp. Think

about the paradox of a vacation. Time seems to fly by while you are away, your days with

filled with new sights and sounds that are not present in your everyday life. And yet when

you return home and look back on your trip, it seems to have lasted longer than a typical

week. You certainly have more specific memories than you do of a regular week at home.</p>

<div class="container4">
    
      <p>This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that there are two different ways our minds respond to

time, prospectively and retrospectively. Prospective time is the ability to correctly estimate

time as it is passing. For example, one might test someone’s perception of prospective

time by having them press a button when one minute has past. Retrospective time is how

we remember time when we look back on it. For example, a way to test this would be to

ask, “How long were we away on our lunch break earlier?” When these two variables fail

to reconcile in our minds, time effectively begins to warp.</p>

<div class="container5">
    
      <p>In this way we are able to manipulate time, by creating and seeking out novel experiences

that our minds are not used to. Imagine your brain as being a warehouse of filing

cabinets. When your brain encounters two very similar days, it effectively files them away

in the same folder. Nothing new was learned, no distinguishing factors, so they get

lumped together. New experiences are essentially written with greater density on the

mind. So upon replay, the more dense memories seem to have lasted longer. By simply

doing something out of our routine, we have, in a way, warped time.</p>

      <p>"Let anyone remember his last eight or ten school years; it is the space of a century.

Compare with them the last eight or ten years of life; it is the space of an hour."­ - Paul

      <p>The negative aspect to this is obvious. As life goes on, we settle into a routine and our

minds need not process as much new information. As a child, many days are filled with

wonder leading to those memories of summers that seemed to pass so slowly they felt

more like years. Later in life our minds have learned most of what we will ever learn, our

days are more monotonous (perhaps by choice; we have learned what we like) and we

lack the spontaneity of our youth. We fear and dread the passage of time, but often do

little to make the most of it.</p>

      <p>The good news is that if we know how, we can use this information to our advantage.

While a weekend spent at home watching TV will no doubt be relaxing and perhaps

occasionally necessary, expect time to go by faster. If you choose to fill your time with

memorable and interesting activities, you are effectively taking time into your hands and

treating it as malleable. It might not seem like it at the time, (we all know time seems to

fly when we are having fun) but looking back on it the time will seemed skewed in our

advantage.</p>

      <p>So, practically, how can we leverage this useful information? We can start by being more

mindful of time. Next time you’re outdoors, take a second to rein in your thoughts and

take in your surroundings. Your inbox can wait. Living in the present and being aware of

how slippery time truly is is the first step in getting a grasp on it. One important goal is to

always keep learning. Seek out new information and be creative in the way you shape

your future-self. The more interesting and rich the topic, the more days you can fill in the

future with novel ideas and learning. Visit places unfamiliar to your mind and be more

spontaneous. We’re essentially trying to throw new things at our mind in order to make

use of those new folders and file cabinets.</p>

<div class="container12">
    
      <p>Another odd but useful bit of practical instruction is to get a good night’s sleep after a day

full of rich experiences. Sleep is when our brains actually upload the day’s events to our

long-term memory. To be sure that they are encoded as vibrant and enjoyable as they

truly were, we must make a good night’s sleep a priority. The next time we look back on a

specific day, the amount of deep sleep we had immediately after, determines how much

detail we are able to recall.</p>

</div>

<div class="container13">
    
      <p>While the science is a bit complicated, the crux is not. Seek unique experiences and slow

down time. Don’t complain about the years flying by if you spend all of your free time in

front of screens. While rest certainly has it’s place, be mindful of the balance. Get out and

enjoy creation, try new foods, meet new people, all the while keeping your fingers on the

rhythmic pulse of the passage of time. Just because you aren’t a child anymore doesn’t

mean there isn’t plenty to do and plenty to learn. Be intentional in the construction of your

past and the hourglass of your mind will reward you.</p>
